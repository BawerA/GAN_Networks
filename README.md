# GAN_Networks
This is Team Machines GitHub for GAN networks.


dcgan.py - -  Our code so far in trying to create our own DCGAN based off of the architecture from the medium article (https://medium.com/@liyin2015/dcgan-79af14a1c247)



modified_keras_gan.py - - This is our heavily modified code based off of the sample code given to us. We did a lot of playing around to see how using different optimizers, activations, batch sizes, and epoch values would affect the generator/discriminator loss and the accuracy of the images created.
